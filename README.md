We propose to build a Cost-effective, efficient, and Decentralized marketplace for small businesses using Blockchain Technology (Polygon), that would enable businesses to make and receive payments, have access to investment and savings products, and build reliable credit history, all on one platform.
This would increase the revenue generated by folds just because it is much more cheaper than the available alternatives like Amazon or Flipkart or just having a website online (that would take effort for maintenance).


Our clients would be Furniture Business owners who would have an account in the website. This would give them a dashboard that they can use to put up their listings. They would be Attaching an NFT to some physical good in the real world. The ownership of the physical good would be transferred from the businessman to the buyer when the buyer purchases something from the website. The creator(the business) will always get some royalty fees whenever the furniture is resold, which is why they would prefer using our platform over others.
