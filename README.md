A decentralized Market Place for small scale businesses

According to a survey recently, small businesses can almost triple their profits just by having an online social presence as it significantly increases the number of potential clients or reach. Apart from the usual Web 2.0 way to build a website for the business where it can facilitate online payments, Blockchain can be used to connect small enterprises to global marketplaces. Many small businesses believe that such advanced technologies are only available to huge corporations that can pay pricey developers, but the truth is that the cost of incorporating blockchain technology into a small business operation is low, in fact, it can be lower than what they would have to spend in the traditional way to do so.

We propose to build a Cost-effective, efficient, and Decentralized marketplace for small businesses using Blockchain Technology (Polygon), that would enable businesses to make and receive payments, have access to investment and savings products, and build reliable credit history, all on one platform.

This would increase the revenue generated by folds just because it is much more cheaper than the available alternatives like Amazon or Flipkart or just having a website online (that would take effort for maintenance).
